# Features

* Just what you need: static pages + a blog with articles
* Responsive design (try it on your phone or tablet)
* System and User Variables templated in
* Nothing else.

*If you really want to go technical:*

* No SQL, no database, just plain .txt files
* No account creation needed, no administration panel, you just drop `.txt` files, written with the famous [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.
* A single PHP file of less than 100 lines of code. [Really](https://github.com/apmuthu/void/blob/master/void_cms/index.php).
* But yet the possibility of having static pages, articles, custom links in menu, etc.

Use it now:
